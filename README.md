# 📊 Seaborn Quantitative Data Visualization

This section covers Seaborn plots used for visualizing quantitative (numerical) data.  
These plots help understand data distribution, relationships, and patterns — essential for AI and ML preprocessing.

## 🔹 Topics Covered
- histplot() – To visualize data distribution with histogram and KDE  
- jointplot() – To show relationship between two variables  
- pairplot() – To visualize pairwise relationships in the entire dataset  
- rugplot() – To show distribution of data points along an axis  

## 🧠 Key Learning
- How to analyze data distribution and relationships using Seaborn  
- Customizing visualizations for better insights  

 *Next:* Categorical Data Visualization  
 Added heatmap, 
 clustermap and
 pivot-based heatmap visualization using seaborn
